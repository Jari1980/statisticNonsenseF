# Statistic Nonsense

<p>This is a React Vite SPA project where I'm testing different charts types from recharts. Data is gathered from Csv file and MySql db, the api "statisticNonsense" needs to be running in order for this to work.</p>
<p>This project uses the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>react-router-dom</ul>
<ul>react-bootstrap</ul>
<ul>axios</ul>
<ul>recharts</ul>
<p>In order to run the application you need to install these by "npm install"</p>
<br />
<p>Page for adding and displaying data from csv file:</p>

<p>Here you can add data to Csv file by clicking on either button, data can be optionally filtered by time, then you can choose to display pie, line or bar chart.</p>
<br />
<p>Page for product CRUD operations for products in db and a couple more charts:</p>
<img width="679" height="1169" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7211cf70-3efc-45b7-a8b9-26bd51025f57" />
<p>Here user can add, remove or edit products and display corresponding data for these by "Donut chart"(quantity), "Scatterplot"(price vs quantity), "Histogram"(price groups) or "Column chart"(total value).</p>
<br />
<p>Happy coding!</p>
